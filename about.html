            <p>well hey!!! <br>You must be here to review about animal liking. Well, i might sy that i am centred on dog.This is because this kind of animal species has the capability to show compassion and care.This anikals go an extra mile to protect their owners.Dont take this wrong but sometimes dogs just outdo even the closest friend that you seem to trust.One thing for sure that makes me like them is the fact that this animal sre very loyal to man and are always there whether needed or not.
                Recent findings have led researchers to believe that our pets may do more for us than we think. A dog's presence may even make a person appear more likable. Two studies were conducted to test this hypothesis. In the first study, 34 subjects viewed photographs of people pictured alone, pictured with a dog, and pictured with flowers. The subjects were asked to rate the person in the photos with regard to four dimensions: approachability, happy looking, relaxed looking, and best photo. The central finding revealed that photos of individuals pictured with a dog were rated higher than photos of individuals pictured without a dog. In the second study 45 subjects were asked to view three types of slides. The three slides consisted of outdoor scenery, a person walking through the outdoor scene, and a person walking a dog through the outdoor scene. Subjects were asked to rate the slides against each other with regard to several aesthetic dimensions, which included easiest to gaze at and best photo. In addition, subjects were asked how they perceived the person photographed with respect to happiness, relaxed looking, and safety. Finally, subjects were asked to choose photos in which they would like to be included. The major results of Study II demonstrated that (1) photos rated highest for questions concerning subjects' feelings toward the slides (easy to gaze at, feeling relaxed, best photo) were the scenery slides shown alone. The second highest rating went to the slides of the person walking the dog. (2) The person shown in the scene was perceived as appearing happier and safer when with the dog.</p>
